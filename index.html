    <h1>Hello, I'm Zahra Sabili ðŸŒ¿</h1>
    <p>I am a graduate of MSc in Plant Biotechnology (Agriculture) from Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran.  
My thesis focused on the regulatory relationship between genes and transcription factors during five days post-anthesis in bread wheat, under the supervision of Dr. Tahmineh Lohrasbi and Dr. Sajjad Rashidi Monfared.

In parallel, I conducted synteny-based identification of EST-SSR markers across ten species of the genus *Oryza*, contributing to comparative genomics and marker development.

Beyond wet-lab research, Iâ€™ve cultivated a strong interest in bioinformatics and programmingâ€”especially in R and Python. I continuously seek to expand my skills and apply them to real-world biological questions.

Recent bioinformatics projects include:

- RNA-seq data analysis using the WGCNA technique  
- Machine learning approaches for gene prioritization  
- Reproducible pipelines for stress-response classification in plants

These experiences bring me closer to my long-term goal: improving nutritional outcomes and, ultimately, enhancing human health through plant science.
